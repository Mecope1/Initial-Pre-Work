/*
Challenge 29:
What I learned: I learned how to use the .length property to find the length of a string and to assign it to a variable.
*/


// Example
var firstNameLength = 0;
var firstName = "Ada";

firstNameLength = firstName.length;

// Setup
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.

lastNameLength = lastName.length;
