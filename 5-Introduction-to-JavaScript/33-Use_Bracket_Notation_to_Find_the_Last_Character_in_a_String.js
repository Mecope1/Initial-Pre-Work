/*
Challenge 33:
What I learned: I learned how to access the last letter of a string, by using the .length property. This differs from
Python as it requires the length of the string to be included.
*/


// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var lastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length-1];
