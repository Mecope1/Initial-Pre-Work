/*
Challenge 51:
What I learned: I learned how to use a return statement with a function to pass a value back to the line the function was
called from.
*/


// Example
function minusSeven(num) {
  return num - 7;
}

// Only change code below this line
function timesFive(num) {
  return num*5
}


console.log(minusSeven(10));

console.log(timesFive(10));
