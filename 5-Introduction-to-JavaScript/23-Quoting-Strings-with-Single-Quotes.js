/*
Challenge 23:
What I learned:I learned how to use single quote marks to create a string. Using these marks mean that double quote
marks can be used WITHOUT needing to use the escape character \ for them. If single quote marks appear in the string,
they will still need their own escape character to prevent the string from ending prematurely.
