/*
Challenge 12:
What I learned: I learned how to use the flex-shrink property to change an item/items within a flex container so that
they change in size when the container itself changes. Each has a reference value of 1 essentially. When a value
greater than 1 is given, that is the factor of size it decreases by in relation to other flex-shrink items. For example:
if item 1 is assigned, "flex-shrink: 1", and item 2 is assigned, "flex-shrink: 5", then each time item 1 shrinks by a
value of X, then item two shrinks by 5*X.

<style>
  #box-container {
    display: flex;
    height: 500px;
  }
  #box-1 {
    background-color: dodgerblue;
    width: 100%;
    height: 200px;
    flex-shrink: 1;
  }

  #box-2 {
    background-color: orangered;
    width: 100%;
    height: 200px;
    flex-shrink: 2;
  }
</style>

<div id="box-container">
  <div id="box-1"></div>
  <div id="box-2"></div>
